## 💡 Key Insights

- **Jaipur:** Highest contributor to Trips (18%) and Revenue (₹37.2M, 34%) but relies heavily on New Passengers (80%).  
- **Lucknow:** Second in Trips (15%) but suffers from low revenue due to poor ratings and low average fare per trip.  
- **Mysore:** Contributes only 4% of Trips but exceeds Trip Targets by 20% with high ratings (above 8.0), indicating high satisfaction and efficiency.  
- **Surat:** Leads in Repeat Passenger Rate (42%) but has the lowest average rating due to minimal fare levels.  
- **Seasonality:** Trips peaked in February and March but declined afterward, while repeat passenger loyalty increased in the later months.
